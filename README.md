# DialogFlow Bot Flutter [Test App Only]

Basically this is a simple app shows you how to deal with DialogFlow APIs built by Flutter with customized UI (TESTS ONLY).

## Things you must consider:
- First you must get the API key of your agent that you create from Google Service Account <br>
See <a href="https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/v2-auth-setup"> Setting up authentication </a>.<br>
- This app uses the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dialogflow"> Dialogflow v1 & v2 Package </a>for handling the API's requests, responses and so on.<br>
- Also uses the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/intl"> intl Packege <a/> for internationalization and localization facilities.<br>
